<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>How does the 30-day free trial work?</h3>

<p>Sign up and get instant access to all MyDojo features for 30 days. No credit card required. Explore the platform, import your students, and see if it's the right fit. If you love it, choose a plan. If not, no hard feelings.</p>

<h3>What happens when I reach my student limit?</h3>

<p>We'll notify you when you're approaching your plan's student capacity. You can easily upgrade to the next tier directly from your dashboard. Your billing adjusts automatically, and there's no interruption to your service.</p>

<h3>Are there any setup fees or hidden costs?</h3>

<p>No setup fees, ever. The price you see is the price you pay. Payment processing runs through Stripe at their standard rates (2.9% + $0.30 per transaction), with no markup from us. We don't take a cut of your revenue.</p>

<h3>Can I cancel anytime?</h3>

<p>Absolutely. There are no lock-in contracts. You can cancel your subscription at any time from your account settings. You'll continue to have access until the end of your current billing period.</p>

<h3>Do you offer annual billing?</h3>

<p>Yes! Pay annually and get 2 months free (16.7% discount). Contact us to set up annual billing for your account.</p>

<h3>What counts as an "active student"?</h3>

<p>Active students are those currently enrolled in your programs with an active or pending membership. Leads, prospects, and inactive/paused students don't count toward your limit.</p>

<h3>Can I manage multiple locations?</h3>

<p>Yes! All plans include unlimited locations. Perfect for schools expanding to multiple dojos or teaching at different facilities.</p>

<h3>What if I have more than 200 students?</h3>

<p>The Enterprise plan supports unlimited students beyond 151. If you're running a large operation with 300+ students, contact us for custom enterprise pricing and dedicated support.</p>
