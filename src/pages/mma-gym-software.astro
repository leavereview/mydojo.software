    question: "What is MMA gym software?",
    answer: "MMA gym software is a management platform designed for mixed martial arts facilities. It handles multi-discipline class scheduling (BJJ, Muay Thai, wrestling, boxing, MMA), fighter development tracking, varied membership models, and unique operational requirements of gyms serving both recreational members and competitive athletes. Software tracks progression across multiple arts simultaneously, manages fight camp scheduling, and provides performance analytics for fighters.",

      { text: 'See pricing', url: '/pricing/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "How does MMA software handle multiple disciplines?",
    answer: "Quality MMA software supports separate class categories, progression systems, and scheduling for each discipline (BJJ, striking, wrestling, MMA). Students can track advancement in each art independently while maintaining a unified membership and payment relationship. You can configure BJJ belt progression (white to black), striking skill levels (beginner/intermediate/advanced), and MMA-specific competition readiness assessments all within one student profile.",

      { text: 'BJJ belt tracking', url: '/bjj-gym-software/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Can MMA software track fighter development?",
    answer: "Yes, competition-focused features include training logs documenting rounds and techniques, sparring session records with partner information, fight history and results, weight tracking for cut management, goal setting and milestone tracking, and video integration for technique review. Coaches can monitor fighter preparation over entire fight camps, identify training gaps, and adjust camp schedules based on performance data.",
    links: [
      { text: 'Fighter tracking features', url: '/martial-arts-software/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "What membership options should MMA software support?",
    answer: "MMA software should accommodate all-access memberships covering every discipline, single-discipline plans (BJJ-only, striking-only), competition team memberships with additional training access, drop-in and punch card options for visitors, private coaching packages sold separately, and family memberships for households training together. MyDojo supports unlimited membership tier configurations with automatic billing and proration for mid-cycle changes.",

      { text: 'Billing features', url: '/martial-arts-billing-software/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "How is MMA software different from BJJ software?",
    answer: "While both handle grappling-specific needs like belt tracking and stripe management, MMA software additionally manages striking classes (Muay Thai, boxing, kickboxing), wrestling programs, and integrated MMA training. It includes fighter development features for competition preparation across all disciplines, weight cut management for fighters competing in multiple weight classes, and reporting that shows member engagement across different martial arts within your facility.",

  },
  {
    question: "Does MMA software track BJJ belt ranks?",
    answer: "Yes, MMA software includes complete BJJ belt progression tracking from white through black belt with 4 stripes per belt, time-in-rank requirements, testing eligibility automation, and promotion history. This exists alongside progression systems for striking (beginner/intermediate/advanced skill levels), wrestling achievement tracking, and MMA competition readiness assessments. Students training multiple disciplines see all their progressions in one unified profile.",

  },
  {
    question: "Can MMA software manage fight camps and competition schedules?",
    answer: "Yes, professional MMA software includes fight camp management with extended private session booking during camps, fighter availability tracking for sparring partners, recovery period blocking after competitions, weigh-in and event date tracking, and camp-specific training plan templates. You can assign sparring partners based on weight class and style matchups, track rounds completed by discipline, and monitor whether fighters are hitting volume targets across their camp.",

  },
  {
    question: "How much does MMA gym software cost?",
    answer: "MMA gym software typically costs £80-200 per month depending on gym size and features. Smaller gyms (under 100 members) find suitable options at £80-120 monthly. Mid-size facilities (100-300 members) pay £120-160. Large MMA academies with competition teams and multiple coaches pay £160-200. Pricing models include flat-rate (unlimited members) or per-member (£1-3 per active member). MyDojo offers £99/month flat-rate for unlimited members.",

    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Can recreational members and fighters use the same system?",
    answer: "Yes, good MMA software serves both populations without forcing either into workflows designed for the other. Recreational members see class schedules, track their skill progression, and manage their memberships. Fighters additionally get training logs, fight history, weight tracking, and camp management tools. Communication can be segmented so competition team announcements only go to fighters while general schedule updates reach everyone.",

      { text: 'CRM features', url: '/martial-arts-crm/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "What reports do MMA gym owners need?",
    answer: "MMA gym analytics should reveal attendance by discipline to optimize scheduling, member distribution across programs (which disciplines are most popular), competition team metrics and fight records, conversion from single-discipline to all-access memberships (cross-sell opportunities), retention differences between recreational and competition members, revenue per coach by discipline, and peak training times to inform staffing decisions. These insights help you allocate mat space, adjust class times, and identify which programs drive the most revenue.",

        <h2>Management Solutions for Mixed Martial Arts Academies</h2>

        <p>
          Mixed martial arts gyms operate at the intersection of multiple combat disciplines: striking, wrestling, and submission grappling converge in training programs that prepare fighters for competition while serving recreational practitioners seeking comprehensive martial arts education.
        </p>

        <p>
          This dual mission—developing competitive athletes alongside recreational members—creates operational complexity that single-discipline schools rarely encounter. MMA gym software addresses these challenges with features designed for multi-discipline environments, fighter management, and the performance tracking that combat sports demand.
        </p>

        <h3>Multi-Discipline Training Structure</h3>

        <p>A typical MMA gym offers instruction across several combat disciplines:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu:</strong> Gi and no-gi sessions with belt progression</li>
          <li><strong>Muay Thai or Kickboxing:</strong> Striking fundamentals through advanced techniques</li>
          <li><strong>Wrestling or Grappling:</strong> Takedowns, control, and ground positioning</li>
          <li><strong>Boxing:</strong> Footwork, head movement, and punching combinations</li>
          <li><strong>MMA-Specific Classes:</strong> Integrated training combining all disciplines</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Each discipline may have its own progression system. BJJ follows belt ranks from white through black. Striking arts may use different advancement structures. Wrestling typically lacks formal ranking altogether. Software must accommodate these parallel systems while maintaining unified student records.
        </p>

        <h3>Recreational vs Competition Focus</h3>

        <p>MMA gyms serve two distinct populations with different needs:</p>

        <p>
          <strong>Recreational Members</strong> want fitness, self-defense skills, and community without competition aspirations. They attend regular classes, progress through curricula, and value the training experience itself.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Competition Fighters</strong> require structured fight preparation, performance analytics, weight management support, and scheduling that accounts for fight camps and recovery periods. Their membership patterns differ significantly from recreational members.
        </p>

        <p>
          Effective MMA software supports both populations without forcing either into workflows designed for the other.
