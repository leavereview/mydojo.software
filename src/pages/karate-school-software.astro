    question: "What is karate school software?",
    answer: "Karate school software is a management platform designed specifically for karate dojos. It handles student databases, kyu-dan belt progression, kata curriculum tracking, class scheduling, testing management, and billing while using karate-appropriate terminology and workflows. Software tracks students through 10 kyu grades to black belt dan ranks, monitors kata mastery, automates testing eligibility, and manages family accounts common in traditional karate schools.",

      { text: 'See pricing', url: '/pricing/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Can karate software track kata progress?",
    answer: "Yes, quality karate software includes kata library management. You can track which kata students have learned, which they're currently studying, and which are required for their next belt level. Some systems link video resources for reference, allow performance notes from instructors, and track competition kata separately from curriculum kata. Kata requirements can be mapped to specific belt ranks and styles (Shotokan, Goju-Ryu, Shito-Ryu, Wado-Ryu).",

      { text: 'Karate belt guide', url: '/blog/karate-belts/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "How does belt testing work in karate software?",
    answer: "The system tracks attendance and time-in-rank to determine testing eligibility automatically. When students qualify based on your criteria (minimum classes, months at current rank, curriculum completion), they can register online and pay testing fees. After the test, results are recorded with pass/fail/defer outcomes, ranks update automatically, and certificates generate with organization logos. Parents receive notification of their children's promotions automatically.",

      { text: 'Belt system explained', url: '/blog/karate-belt-order-complete-guide/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Does karate software support different styles?",
    answer: "Yes, configurable systems support various karate styles (Shotokan, Goju-Ryu, Shito-Ryu, Wado-Ryu, Kyokushin) with custom belt colors, kata lists, and testing requirements specific to each style's traditions. You can manage multiple styles within the same dojo, track style-specific curriculum, and maintain separate rank progressions. Many schools teaching both traditional and sport karate use different curriculum tracks within one system.",

      { text: 'Karate styles overview', url: '/blog/types-of-martial-arts/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Can parents manage children's accounts?",
    answer: "Yes, family accounts allow parents to manage multiple children from a single login. They can view schedules, track belt progress for each child, make consolidated payments with automatic sibling discounts, receive communications about their children's training, and access progress reports. Parents see which kata their children are learning, when they're eligible for testing, and attendance patterns. Youth students (under 16) don't get direct system access for safety.",

      { text: 'Family features', url: '/martial-arts-software/' }

  },
  {
    question: "How much does karate school software cost?",
    answer: "Most karate software costs £50-150 per month depending on student count and features. Smaller schools (under 75 students) typically find options at £50-80 monthly. Mid-size schools (75-200 students) pay £80-120. Larger academies or multi-location operations pay £120-200. Pricing models include flat-rate (unlimited students) or per-student (£1-2 per active student). MyDojo offers £79/month flat-rate for unlimited students.",

  },
  {
    question: "Can I try karate software before committing?",
    answer: "Most karate school software providers offer free trials ranging from 14 to 30 days. This allows you to test features with your actual student data, train your staff on the platform, evaluate how well it fits your dojo operations, and assess whether students and parents adopt the system easily. MyDojo offers a 14-day trial with full feature access, no credit card required, and includes onboarding support.",

    ]
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between karate software and general gym software?",
    answer: "Karate-specific software understands kyu-dan rank systems with 10 kyu grades before black belt, tracks kata curriculum progress across kihon/kata/kumite components, manages testing cycles with eligibility automation, and uses appropriate terminology (sensei, dojo, gi, kata) instead of generic gym language (trainer, facility, uniform, workout). General gym software can't track belt progression, doesn't understand age-based dan rank restrictions, and lacks kata library management.",

      { text: 'Dojo management guide', url: '/dojo-management-software/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Can software track organization and federation requirements?",
    answer: "Yes, professional karate software tracks organization membership (JKA, SKA, WKF, ISKF, etc.) with federation-specific rank requirements, registration processes, and dan rank recognition. You can configure minimum time-in-rank based on organization standards, track federation dues and renewals, and generate reports for federation audits. Some systems integrate directly with national governing bodies for digital rank certificates and competition registration.",
    links: [
      { text: 'Organization features', url: '/martial-arts-software/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to implement karate software?",
    answer: "Most karate schools complete implementation in 4-6 weeks. Week 1-2: data collection (student records, rank history, belt structure documentation). Week 3-4: system configuration (belt colors, kata lists, testing criteria, pricing setup, data import). Week 5: staff training and parallel operation with existing systems. Week 6+: full deployment with student onboarding. Smaller schools (under 50 students) often launch in 2-3 weeks. Larger schools with complex federation requirements may need 8-10 weeks.",

        <h2>Management Solutions Built for Karate Dojos</h2>

        <p>
          Karate instruction follows a structured path developed over generations: the systematic progression through belt ranks, the refinement of kata, the cultivation of both physical technique and mental discipline. Running a karate school in the modern era requires balancing these time-tested traditions with contemporary business demands.
        </p>

        <p>
          Karate school software bridges this divide by handling administrative complexity while respecting the pedagogical structures that define karate education. From tracking students through the kyu ranks to managing kihon, kata, and kumite curriculum requirements, purpose-built software supports rather than disrupts the training methodology you have established.
        </p>

        <h3>The Kyu-Dan Ranking System</h3>

        <p>
          Karate follows a colored belt progression through kyu grades before reaching dan (black belt) ranks. While belt colors vary by style and organization, the structure remains consistent:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>10th-9th Kyu (White/Yellow):</strong> Basic stances, fundamental blocks and strikes</li>
          <li><strong>8th-7th Kyu (Orange/Red):</strong> Basic kata, combination techniques, stance work</li>
          <li><strong>6th-5th Kyu (Green):</strong> Intermediate kata, sparring introduction, timing</li>
          <li><strong>4th-3rd Kyu (Purple/Blue):</strong> Advanced kata, free sparring, self-defense</li>
          <li><strong>2nd-1st Kyu (Brown):</strong> Black belt kata, teaching basics, competition preparation</li>
          <li><strong>1st Dan+ (Black):</strong> Advanced study, teaching responsibilities, style mastery</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Software must track not just current rank but progression history, time-in-rank, attendance requirements, and specific technique mastery at each level.
        </p>

        <h3>Curriculum Components: Kihon, Kata, and Kumite</h3>

        <p><strong>Kihon (Basics):</strong></p>
        <p>
          Fundamental techniques including stances, blocks, strikes, and kicks practiced in isolation and combination. Mastery at each level requires demonstrating specific kihon elements.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Kata (Forms):</strong></p>
        <p>
          Choreographed sequences representing combat scenarios. Each rank requires learning specific kata. Software should track which kata students have learned and are currently studying. Want to understand the complete belt system? See our <a href="/blog/karate-belts/">karate belt colors and order guide</a>.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Kumite (Sparring):</strong></p>
        <p>
          Partner practice ranging from pre-arranged drills to free sparring. Different ranks introduce different sparring formats with progressive contact levels.
        </p>

        <p>
          Effective karate software provides curriculum tracking across all three areas, ensuring students meet requirements before testing.

        <h2>Style-Specific Considerations</h2>

        <h3>Belt Color Variations</h3>
        <p>
          While the kyu-dan structure remains consistent, colors differ across styles. Shotokan traditionally uses white, yellow, orange, green, purple, brown, and black. Other styles may include additional colors or different sequences. Software should allow custom color configuration for each rank.
        </p>

        <h3>Organization Requirements</h3>
        <p>
          Many karate schools affiliate with larger organizations (JKA, SKA, WKF, ISKF, etc.) that impose specific testing requirements, registration processes, and rank recognition. Software should track organization membership and support their administrative requirements.
