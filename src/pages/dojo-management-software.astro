    question: "What is dojo management software?",
    answer: "Dojo management software is a specialized platform for traditional martial arts schools. It handles student databases, kyu/dan rank tracking, grading ceremonies, class scheduling, and billing while using terminology and workflows appropriate to the dojo environment rather than generic gym language. Software tracks progression through belt systems, manages testing eligibility, maintains curriculum records, and supports family account relationships common in traditional training environments.",

      { text: 'See pricing', url: '/pricing/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "How is dojo software different from gym software?",
    answer: "Dojo software is purpose-built for martial arts operations. It includes belt rank progression tracking, testing eligibility automation, curriculum management, and grading ceremony coordination—features absent from generic gym platforms. It also uses appropriate terminology (students vs members, dojo vs facility, sensei vs trainer, gi vs uniform) and understands cultural protocols like hierarchical student-teacher relationships, ceremonial aspects of testing, and multi-year developmental timelines.",

      { text: 'Dojo vs gym software', url: '/martial-arts-software/' },
      { text: 'Karate-specific features', url: '/karate-school-software/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Can dojo software track multiple martial arts?",
    answer: "Yes, quality dojo software supports multiple disciplines with separate rank tracks. A school teaching both Karate and Judo can maintain independent belt progressions, testing schedules, and curriculum requirements for each art while sharing student accounts and billing. You can configure different kyu/dan systems, belt colors, and testing criteria per discipline. Students training in multiple arts see all their progressions in one unified profile.",

      { text: 'Multi-discipline tracking', url: '/martial-arts-software/' },
      { text: 'MMA features', url: '/mma-gym-software/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "How does testing management work?",
    answer: "Testing management includes automatic eligibility determination based on attendance and time-in-rank, test scheduling with capacity limits, student registration and fee collection, grading panel assignment and permissions, results recording with pass/fail/defer outcomes, certificate generation with proper formatting, and automatic rank updates upon passing. The system sends eligibility notifications to qualified students, tracks who's registered, and maintains complete testing history for each student.",

      { text: 'Testing features', url: '/martial-arts-software/' },
      { text: 'Karate belt guide', url: '/blog/karate-belts/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "What should dojo software cost?",
    answer: "Dojo management software typically costs £50-200 per month depending on student count and features. Smaller dojos (under 100 students) often find suitable options at £50-80 monthly. Mid-size schools (100-250 students) pay £80-120. Larger schools with advanced features or multiple locations may pay £120-200. Per-student pricing models charge £1-3 per active student. MyDojo offers £79/month flat-rate for unlimited students.",

      { text: 'Feature comparison', url: '/martial-arts-software/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Can I import my existing student records?",
    answer: "Most dojo software accepts data imports from spreadsheets or other platforms. You can typically import student contact information, current rank and belt history, membership details, attendance records, and family relationships. Data migration involves exporting from your current system (or compiling spreadsheets), mapping fields to new system, importing data, and verifying accuracy. Allow 1-2 weeks for data migration and verification. Support teams usually assist with imports.",

      { text: 'Contact support', url: '/contact/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Do students get their own login?",
    answer: "Yes, student portals provide individual access for viewing schedules, tracking rank progress toward next belt, managing payments, and communicating with instructors. Parents receive portal access for youth student accounts (under 16), allowing them to monitor progress, handle administrative tasks, view attendance, and see which techniques their children are learning. Adult students get direct access. Portals are mobile-friendly for on-the-go access.",
    links: [
      { text: 'Student portal features', url: '/martial-arts-software/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "How does family billing work?",
    answer: "Family accounts link related students under shared billing. The system automatically applies sibling discounts (e.g., 10% off second child, 15% off third+), consolidates invoices into single monthly charge, and allows parents to manage payments for multiple children from one dashboard while maintaining individual progress tracking for each student. You configure discount percentages and family membership pricing. Parents see itemized breakdown showing each child's fees and applied discounts.",

      { text: 'Family features', url: '/martial-arts-software/' },
      { text: 'Billing options', url: '/martial-arts-billing-software/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Can dojo software handle organization requirements?",
    answer: "Yes, professional dojo software tracks organization and federation affiliations (JKA, SKA, WKF, IOGKF, etc.) with federation-specific rank requirements, minimum time-in-rank standards, and dan grade restrictions. You can configure different testing criteria based on organization rules, track federation membership and dues, generate reports for organization audits, and maintain proper rank certificates with organization logos and signatures. This ensures compliance with governing body standards.",

      { text: 'Organization features', url: '/martial-arts-software/' },
      { text: 'Karate federations', url: '/karate-school-software/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "What implementation timeline should I expect?",
    answer: "Most dojos complete implementation in 4-6 weeks. Week 1-2: Data collection (audit student records, document rank structure, map current operations). Week 3-4: System configuration (set up belt colors, curriculum checklists, testing criteria, pricing, import student data). Week 5: Staff training and parallel operation with existing systems. Week 6+: Full deployment with student onboarding. Smaller dojos (under 75 students) often launch in 3-4 weeks. Complex multi-location or multi-discipline schools may need 8 weeks.",

        <h2>Purpose-Built Technology for Traditional Martial Arts Schools</h2>

        <p>
          The traditional dojo operates on principles refined over centuries: respect, discipline, continuous improvement. Yet the administrative demands of running a modern martial arts school bear little resemblance to the straightforward student-teacher relationships of historical training halls.
        </p>

        <p>
          Dojo management software bridges this gap between traditional values and modern operational requirements. These specialized platforms handle the business complexity that would otherwise distract from instruction, enabling senseis and school owners to maintain focus on what matters most: developing their students' skills and character.
        </p>

        <h3>Understanding the Dojo Environment</h3>

        <p>
          The word <strong>'dojo'</strong> translates roughly to 'place of the way'—a training hall where students pursue mastery through disciplined practice. This cultural foundation influences every aspect of how a dojo operates, from the hierarchical structure of ranks to the ceremonial elements of class conduct.
        </p>

        <p>
          Effective dojo management software acknowledges these cultural elements rather than imposing generic gym terminology. When software refers to 'members' rather than 'students', 'facilities' rather than 'training halls', or 'fitness levels' rather than 'belt ranks', it creates friction that undermines the training environment.
        </p>

        <h3>What Makes Dojo Operations Unique</h3>

        <p>Traditional martial arts schools differ from fitness facilities in several fundamental ways:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Hierarchical progression systems</strong> with formal testing requirements</li>
          <li><strong>Curriculum-based instruction</strong> rather than freestyle training</li>
          <li><strong>Cultural protocols and terminology</strong> specific to martial tradition</li>
          <li><strong>Student-teacher relationships</strong> that extend beyond transactional service</li>
          <li><strong>Long-term developmental focus</strong> measured in years, not weeks</li>
          <li><strong>Community aspects</strong> including seminars, competitions, and lineage connections</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Generic gym software designed for drop-in fitness classes cannot accommodate these distinctive elements.
