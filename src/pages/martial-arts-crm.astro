    question: "What is a martial arts CRM?",
    answer: "A martial arts CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system tracks prospects and students through their entire journey—from initial inquiry through trial class, enrollment, and ongoing training. It automates lead follow-ups, manages trial class workflows, identifies retention risks, and provides timeline visibility into every student relationship. Martial arts CRMs understand belt progression, family relationships, and multi-year student lifecycles unlike generic sales CRMs.",

      { text: 'See pricing', url: '/pricing/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "How does CRM help convert leads to students?",
    answer: "CRM increases conversions through automated lead response (within 4 minutes vs hours manually), systematic follow-up sequences that prevent leads from falling through cracks, trial class scheduling automation with reminder sequences, lead source tracking to identify best marketing channels, and nurture campaigns for not-yet-ready prospects. Schools using CRM see 42% lead conversion vs 24% without systematic follow-up.",

      { text: 'Marketing guide', url: '/blog/martial-arts-marketing-tips/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between martial arts CRM and general CRM?",
    answer: "Martial arts CRM understands trial class workflows, belt rank progression milestones, family account relationships, multi-year student lifecycles (not single transactions), attendance-based engagement tracking, and billing integration for member status. General CRMs like Salesforce track deals and one-time sales. Martial arts CRM tracks relationships spanning years with progression milestones, family dynamics, and ongoing engagement patterns unique to training environments.",

      { text: 'Compare software', url: '/blog/best-martial-arts-software/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Can CRM identify students at risk of quitting?",
    answer: "Yes, retention-focused CRM tracks engagement indicators like declining attendance patterns, missed classes without makeups, overdue payments, no-shows to scheduled classes, stagnant belt progression, and decreased training frequency. When risk patterns emerge, automated alerts notify instructors to intervene personally before the student quits. Schools using proactive engagement tracking see 23% better retention compared to reactive approaches.",
    links: [
      { text: 'Retention features', url: '/martial-arts-software/' },
      { text: 'Retention strategies', url: '/blog/member-retention-strategies/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "How does automated follow-up work?",
    answer: "Automated follow-up sequences trigger based on lead actions and time intervals. When someone inquires, they immediately receive confirmation and school information. Day 2: Follow-up offering trial class. Day 4: Additional value content about benefits. Day 7: Special offer or urgency element. After trial class: Immediate thank-you, next-day enrollment invitation, ongoing nurture if not enrolled. Automation ensures 95% follow-up completion vs 35% manual completion.",
    links: [
      { text: 'Automation features', url: '/martial-arts-software/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Does martial arts CRM integrate with billing?",
    answer: "Yes, CRM integration with billing provides unified student view showing payment status, membership type, payment history, failed payment alerts, and upcoming renewals alongside engagement data. This integration identifies high-risk situations like declining attendance plus payment issues, enables targeted campaigns to upgrade members from single to all-access, and tracks lifetime value per student including original lead source.",

      { text: 'Billing integration', url: '/martial-arts-billing-software/' },
      { text: 'All features', url: '/martial-arts-software/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "How much does martial arts CRM cost?",
    answer: "Martial arts CRM is typically included in comprehensive martial arts software (£79-150/month total) rather than sold separately. Standalone CRM platforms cost £20-80/month but lack martial arts context like belt tracking and attendance integration. Schools benefit more from integrated CRM within martial arts software where lead data connects to attendance, billing, and progression tracking. MyDojo includes full CRM capabilities in all plans starting at £79/month.",

      { text: 'View pricing', url: '/pricing/' },
      { text: 'Feature comparison', url: '/martial-arts-software/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Can CRM track lead sources and marketing ROI?",
    answer: "Yes, good martial arts CRM tracks where each lead originated (Google Ads, Facebook, referral, walk-in, event), calculates cost per lead by source, measures conversion rates by channel, identifies which marketing generates highest lifetime value students, and attributes revenue back to original source. This data shows whether your £500/month Facebook ads generate better ROI than £300/month Google Ads based on actual enrollments and lifetime value.",

      { text: 'Marketing guide', url: '/blog/martial-arts-marketing-tips/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "What reports do martial arts CRM provide?",
    answer: "CRM reports include lead pipeline by stage (inquiry, trial scheduled, trial completed, enrolled, lost), conversion rates at each stage, lead response times, follow-up completion rates, lead sources and conversion by source, trial show rate, trial-to-member conversion, student engagement scores, retention risk alerts, student lifetime value, and marketing ROI by channel. These metrics identify bottlenecks in your conversion process and retention weak points.",

      { text: 'Reporting features', url: '/martial-arts-software/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "How long does CRM implementation take?",
    answer: "Basic CRM setup takes 1-2 weeks: import existing leads and students (Day 1-3), configure lead sources and stages (Day 4-5), set up automated follow-up sequences (Day 6-8), train staff on lead management (Day 9-10), launch and monitor first leads (Week 2). Advanced features like custom workflows, retention scoring, and complex segmentation add 1-2 weeks. Most schools see positive ROI within first month through improved lead conversion alone.",

        <h2>Lead Management and Student Relationship Tools</h2>

        <p>
          Every martial arts school faces the same fundamental challenge: converting interested prospects into enrolled students, then nurturing those students into long-term members. A martial arts CRM system provides the infrastructure to manage both sides of this equation systematically.
        </p>

        <p>
          Unlike generic CRM platforms designed for sales teams or retail businesses, martial arts CRM functionality addresses the specific journey from initial inquiry through trial class, enrollment, and ongoing retention. These tools recognize that a martial arts student relationship spans years rather than single transactions.
        </p>

        <h3>CRM Functions in Martial Arts</h3>

        <p><strong>Lead Management:</strong></p>
        <p>
          Handles the pre-enrollment phase—capturing inquiries, nurturing prospects, scheduling trials, and converting interested parties into paying students. This front-end function directly impacts school growth.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Student Relationship Management:</strong></p>
        <p>
          Addresses the post-enrollment phase—tracking engagement, identifying retention risks, managing communications, and building the long-term relationships that create lifetime students.
        </p>

        <p>
          Effective martial arts CRM integrates both functions, creating continuity from first contact through years of training.
