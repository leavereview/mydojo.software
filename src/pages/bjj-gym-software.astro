    question: 'What is BJJ gym software?',
    answer: 'BJJ gym software is a specialized management platform designed for Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu academies.

  },
  {
    question: 'How much does BJJ gym management software cost?',
    answer: 'BJJ gym software typically costs £50-200 per month depending on your student count. Most platforms use per-student pricing (£1-3 per active student) or tiered plans. MyDojo offers flat-rate pricing with unlimited students starting at £79/month.',

    question: 'Does BJJ gym software work for competition teams?',

    answer: 'BJJ software handles automated recurring billing for monthly memberships, private lesson packages, competition team fees, and testing fees.

          BJJ gym software is a specialized management platform designed for Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu academies.
          It handles student databases with IBJJF belt tracking, stripe management, class scheduling,
          competition records, membership billing, and attendance—specifically tailored for BJJ instruction
          rather than generic gym management.

        <h2>The Complete Management Platform for BJJ Academies</h2>

        <p>
          Running a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu academy involves unique challenges that generic gym software simply cannot address.
          From tracking stripe promotions through the intricate IBJJF belt system, to managing competition teams, to
          coordinating open mat sessions alongside structured classes—BJJ schools need purpose-built technology.
        </p>

        <p>
          This comprehensive guide examines everything you need to know about BJJ gym management software: the essential
          features for BJJ-specific operations, how belt progression tracking works, pricing considerations, and how to
          choose the right platform for your academy.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Why BJJ-Specific Software Matters:</strong></p>

        <ul>
          <li>Generic gym software doesn't understand gi vs. no-gi class distinctions</li>
          <li>Traditional martial arts software lacks competition team management</li>
          <li>Standard systems can't track IBJJF stripe promotions</li>
          <li>General platforms don't handle multiple class types (fundamentals, advanced, drilling, competition)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Essential Features for BJJ Academies</h2>

        <h3>1. IBJJF-Compliant Belt System</h3>

        <p>
          The International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation (IBJJF) defines specific progression paths for adults and children.
          Your software must support:
        </p>

        <p><strong>Adult Belt Progression:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>White → Blue → Purple → Brown → Black</li>
          <li>4 stripes per belt (except black belt)</li>
          <li>Minimum time-in-grade requirements</li>
          <li>Age restrictions for certain promotions</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Children's Belt System:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>White → Gray → Yellow → Orange → Green</li>
          <li>Transition to adult system at age 16</li>
          <li>Different stripe requirements</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Stripe Management</h3>

        <p>Unlike other martial arts, BJJ uses stripes to mark incremental progress between belt colors:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Track individual stripe awards with dates</li>
          <li>Automatic notifications when students qualify for next stripe</li>
          <li>Visual stripe displays in student profiles</li>
          <li>Instructor notes for each stripe promotion</li>
          <li>Photo documentation of promotions</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Class Type Management</h3>

        <p>BJJ academies typically offer multiple class formats:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Fundamentals Classes:</strong> Basic techniques for white/blue belts</li>
          <li><strong>Advanced Classes:</strong> Complex techniques for purple+ belts</li>
          <li><strong>Competition Training:</strong> Intense sparring and strategy</li>
          <li><strong>Open Mat:</strong> Unstructured training time</li>
          <li><strong>Drilling Sessions:</strong> Technique repetition focus</li>
          <li><strong>No-Gi Classes:</strong> Training without traditional gi</li>
          <li><strong>Kids Classes:</strong> Age-specific programs</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Your software must handle:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Different pricing for class types</li>
          <li>Capacity limits per class</li>
          <li>Eligibility restrictions by belt level</li>
          <li>Gi vs. no-gi designation</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Competition Team Management</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Upcoming tournament registration</li>
          <li>Weight class monitoring</li>
          <li>Registration fee processing</li>
          <li>Team transportation coordination</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Competition Records:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Win/loss records by competition</li>
          <li>Submission types achieved</li>

          <li>Medal/trophy tracking</li>
          <li>IBJJF ranking points</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Team Scheduling:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Competition-specific training sessions</li>

          <li>Weight cutting guidance scheduling</li>
          <li>Video review sessions</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Private Lesson Coordination</h3>

        <p>Many BJJ practitioners supplement group classes with private instruction:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Instructor-specific scheduling</li>
          <li>Different pricing tiers per instructor</li>
          <li>Private lesson packages</li>
          <li>Technique focus tracking</li>
          <li>Progress notes per session</li>
        </ul>
