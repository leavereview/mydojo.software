    question: "What is martial arts scheduling software?",
    answer: "Martial arts scheduling software is a specialized booking system designed for dojos and martial arts schools. Unlike generic scheduling tools, it understands belt ranks, skill prerequisites, multi-instructor classes, family bookings, and the unique complexities of martial arts programs. It automates class reminders, manages capacity by skill level, enables student self-service booking, and tracks attendance patterns to reduce no-shows and optimize class sizes.",

      { text: 'See pricing', url: '/pricing/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "How does automated scheduling reduce no-shows?",
    answer: "Automated reminders via SMS and email 24-48 hours before class dramatically reduce no-shows. Students can confirm attendance or cancel with one click, allowing waitlisted students to fill the spot automatically. The system tracks no-show patterns and can flag chronic offenders for instructor follow-up, improving overall attendance accountability.",

      { text: 'Contact us', url: '/contact/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Can students book their own classes?",
    answer: "Yes. MyDojo provides a student portal and mobile app where members can view their schedule, book available classes, join waitlists, and manage their bookings. The system automatically enforces belt-level restrictions, class capacity limits, and membership tier access. This self-service reduces admin phone calls by 70% while giving students the flexibility they expect.",

      { text: 'Start free trial', url: '/contact/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "How does skill-based scheduling work?",
    answer: "You can set belt rank or skill requirements for each class. When students try to book, the system checks their current rank and only shows classes they're eligible to attend. This prevents white belts from accidentally booking advanced classes and ensures proper skill segregation. Instructors can also manually override restrictions for special cases.",

      { text: 'BJJ features', url: '/bjj-school-software/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Can I manage multiple instructors' schedules?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Each instructor has their own calendar, availability settings, and class assignments. The system prevents double-booking instructors across locations or time slots. You can assign primary and assistant instructors to classes, track their teaching hours, and manage substitute instructor workflows when someone is unavailable.",

      { text: 'See pricing', url: '/pricing/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "How do recurring schedules work?",
    answer: "Create schedule templates that repeat weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly. For example, set \"Kids Karate\" to run Monday/Wednesday/Friday at 4pm with a specific instructor and capacity. The system automatically generates these classes for your chosen timeframe and allows exceptions for holidays or special events without disrupting the overall pattern.",

      { text: 'Start trial', url: '/contact/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "What happens when a class fills up?",
    answer: "Students are automatically placed on a waitlist and notified when spots open. If a booked student cancels, the first person on the waitlist receives an immediate notification with a booking link. This automation fills last-minute cancellations and maximizes class attendance without staff intervention.",

  },
  {
    question: "Can I schedule private lessons?",
    answer: "Yes. MyDojo handles both group classes and one-on-one private lessons. Students can book available private lesson slots with their preferred instructor. The system tracks private lesson packages, automatically deducts sessions, and alerts students when their package is running low. You can also set different pricing for different instructors or session lengths.",

  },
  {
    question: "How does family scheduling work?",
    answer: "Parents can book classes for all their children from one account and coordinate schedules to minimize trips. The system shows color-coded family calendars and alerts parents to scheduling conflicts (like two kids having classes at different locations simultaneously). This visibility helps families plan their week and reduces no-shows caused by forgotten commitments.",

  },
  {
    question: "What scheduling reports are available?",
    answer: "Track class utilization rates, peak attendance times, no-show patterns by student or class, instructor teaching hours, and booking lead times. These insights help you optimize your schedule by identifying underutilized time slots, overbooked classes that need additional sections, and which class types drive the most engagement. Export data to analyze trends over time.",

        <h2>Why Martial Arts Schools Need Specialized Scheduling</h2>
        <p>
          Managing a martial arts school schedule involves complexity that generic booking systems can't handle. You're not just filling time slots—you're coordinating multiple instructors across belt levels, enforcing skill prerequisites, managing family bookings where parents juggle multiple children's schedules, and handling both group classes and private lessons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Manual scheduling with paper calendars or basic digital tools creates bottlenecks. Staff spend hours answering phone calls about class availability, manually checking belt requirements, and chasing down students to fill last-minute cancellations. Without automated reminders, no-show rates can reach 30-40%, leaving instructors teaching half-empty classes and wasting valuable mat time.
        </p>

        <h2>Automated Reminders Dramatically Reduce No-Shows</h2>
        <p>
          The single biggest scheduling win is automated class reminders. MyDojo sends SMS and email notifications 24-48 hours before each class with one-click confirmation links. Students can confirm attendance, cancel if needed, or add the class to their personal calendar—all from their phone in seconds.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a student cancels with advance notice, the system immediately notifies waitlisted students that a spot opened. The first person to respond gets the slot automatically. This automation fills classes without staff intervention and reduces no-shows by an average of 58% according to our client data.
        </p>

        <h2>Student Self-Service Booking Reduces Admin Load</h2>
        <p>
          Give students control of their schedules through a mobile app and web portal. They can browse available classes, see which instructors are teaching, check current enrollment numbers, and book their spot instantly. The system automatically enforces belt-level restrictions, membership tier access, and class capacity limits.
        </p>
        <p>
          This self-service dramatically reduces phone calls—our clients report 70% fewer scheduling inquiries. Staff time previously spent on the phone answering "What time is the advanced class?" and "Can I bring a friend?" is redirected to higher-value activities like trial class follow-up and student engagement.
        </p>

        <h2>Skill-Based Class Restrictions</h2>
        <p>
          Different belt ranks need different training. MyDojo lets you set minimum belt requirements for each class. White belts only see beginner classes in their booking portal, while black belts can access all levels. This prevents awkward situations where new students accidentally book advanced sparring sessions they're not ready for.
        </p>
        <p>
          The system checks eligibility automatically based on the student's current rank in their profile. As students progress and earn new belts, their available class options expand automatically. Instructors can manually override restrictions for special cases, like allowing a talented student to try the next level early.
        </p>

        <h2>Real-Time Capacity Management</h2>
        <p>
          Set maximum capacity for each class based on mat space, instructor ratios, or equipment availability. The system displays real-time enrollment numbers so students know if a class is filling up. When capacity is reached, new students join a waitlist instead of being turned away.
        </p>
        <p>
          Capacity can vary by class type. Your kids' beginners class might max out at 20 students for safety, while adult sparring is capped at 12 due to space constraints. Competition team training might have unlimited capacity. These limits are enforced automatically, preventing overcrowding without staff having to manually track numbers.
        </p>

        <h2>Multi-Instructor Coordination</h2>
        <p>
          Schools with multiple instructors need visibility into everyone's schedule. MyDojo shows a consolidated calendar across all instructors and locations. You can see at a glance who's teaching what, identify gaps in coverage, and prevent double-booking instructors across simultaneous classes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each instructor has personal availability settings—marking when they're available to teach, unavailable due to travel, or only available at certain locations. When creating new classes, the system only suggests instructors who are available at that time. Substitute instructor workflows handle last-minute coverage needs.
        </p>

        <h2>Recurring Schedule Templates</h2>
        <p>
          Most martial arts schools run the same schedule every week. Create a template once—"Kids Karate Monday/Wednesday/Friday 4pm with Instructor John, capacity 20"—and the system generates all those classes automatically for the next 3-6 months. Make exceptions for holidays or special events without disrupting the overall pattern.
        </p>
        <p>
          Templates handle complex patterns like alternating weeks (beginners week 1, intermediate week 2) or monthly specialty classes. When you update a template, you can choose whether to apply changes to all future classes or just new ones, preserving any manual adjustments already made.
        </p>

        <h2>Waitlist Management</h2>
        <p>
          Popular classes fill up quickly, especially during peak evening hours. Rather than turning students away, place them on an automated waitlist. When someone cancels, the first person on the waitlist receives an instant notification via SMS and email with a link to claim the spot.
        </p>
        <p>
          Waitlists are first-come, first-served by default, but you can prioritize by membership level (unlimited members before limited class packages) or manually override the order. Students can join waitlists for multiple classes and are automatically removed from other waitlists when they book a conflicting time slot.
        </p>

        <h2>Family Scheduling Coordination</h2>
        <p>
          Parents with multiple children training at your school need to coordinate schedules to minimize trips. MyDojo's family calendar shows all children's classes in one view with color-coding by child. Parents instantly see if two kids have overlapping classes at different locations—a scheduling conflict they need to resolve.
        </p>
        <p>
          The system alerts parents to conflicts when they try to book. It can also suggest alternative classes that work for the whole family, like back-to-back sessions where one child finishes right as another begins. This coordination reduces no-shows caused by forgotten commitments and helps families plan their week.
        </p>

        <h2>Private Lesson Scheduling</h2>
        <p>
          Many schools offer private one-on-one lessons alongside group classes. MyDojo handles both in one system. Set up private lesson time blocks for each instructor, define session lengths (30min, 60min, 90min), and set pricing that can vary by instructor or session length.
        </p>
        <p>
          Students book available private lesson slots through the same portal they use for group classes. The system tracks private lesson packages—if a student purchased 10 sessions, each booking automatically deducts from their balance. Automated alerts notify students when they have 2 sessions remaining so they can purchase their next package.
        </p>

        <h2>Attendance Tracking Integration</h2>
        <p>
          Scheduling and attendance work together. When students book a class, they appear on that class's attendance roster. Instructors mark attendance from a tablet or phone, and the system tracks no-shows, late arrivals, and consistent attendance patterns.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chronic no-shows trigger automated follow-up. After 3 missed classes, the system can send a re-engagement email or flag the student for staff outreach. Conversely, students with perfect attendance streaks can receive recognition or rewards, encouraging continued commitment.
        </p>

        <h2>Scheduling Analytics & Optimization</h2>
        <p>
          Data reveals opportunities to optimize your schedule. Track class utilization rates to identify underbooked time slots that might be candidates for cancellation or combination with other classes. See which class times have the highest demand so you can add capacity where it's needed most.
        </p>
        <p>
          Analyze no-show patterns by class type, time of day, or individual student to understand why people aren't attending. Track how far in advance students typically book classes—if most book day-of, your schedule might not be visible enough or students don't feel classes will fill up.
        </p>

        <h2>Mobile App for On-The-Go Booking</h2>
        <p>
          Students expect mobile convenience. MyDojo's mobile app lets members manage their entire schedule from their phone. Book classes while commuting, get push notifications for reminders and waitlist openings, and view their upcoming schedule at a glance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The app syncs with device calendars so booked classes automatically appear in Apple Calendar or Google Calendar alongside their other commitments. Students can enable push notifications for specific class types (only notify me about sparring sessions) to reduce notification fatigue.
        </p>

        <h2>Integration with Billing</h2>
        <p>
          Scheduling connects to your billing system. Membership tiers determine which classes students can book (unlimited members access all classes, basic members get 8/month). The system automatically enforces these limits and prompts students to upgrade when they hit their cap.
        </p>
        <p>
          For drop-in classes or special workshops, scheduling can charge per-class fees directly. Students book the class and pay in one transaction. This works for guest passes, trial classes, or premium workshops that have separate pricing from regular memberships.
        </p>

        <h2>Getting Started with MyDojo Scheduling</h2>
        <p>
          Implementation takes 1-2 weeks from signup to launch. You'll import your current class schedule, set capacity limits and skill requirements, configure automated reminder timing, and invite students to create their portal accounts. Most schools see immediate benefits—fewer phone calls and better class attendance—within the first billing cycle.
