## Taekwondo Belt Order and Colors: The Complete Guide to TKD Belt Ranks

The taekwondo belt system marks a student's journey from white belt beginner to black belt practitioner—and beyond. Like karate, taekwondo uses coloured belts to indicate rank, but the specific colours, order, and requirements vary between the major taekwondo organisations.

This guide covers the complete taekwondo belt ranking system, including differences between World Taekwondo (WT, formerly WTF) and International Taekwondo Federation (ITF) systems, what each belt colour represents, and typical requirements for advancement.

## Taekwondo Belt Order: Standard Progression

While specific colours vary by organisation and school, the most common taekwondo belt order is:

**Belt ColorTypical RankMeaning**White10th GupPurity, innocence—the beginning of the journeyYellow9th-8th GupEarth/seed—the foundation from which growth beginsOrange7th GupGrowing sun—knowledge is increasing (some schools)Green6th-5th GupGrowth—skills are developing like a plantBlue4th-3rd GupSky/heaven—reaching upward toward masteryRed2nd-1st GupDanger—signifies power that must be controlledBlack1st Dan+Maturity and mastery of basics; beginning of deeper study

Many schools add intermediate belts (yellow-green stripe, green-blue stripe, etc.) to create more frequent promotion opportunities, particularly for children's programmes.

## The Gup and Dan System

Taekwondo uses the Korean terms "gup" (also spelled geup or kup) for coloured belt ranks and "dan" for black belt degrees:

## Gup Ranks (Coloured Belts)

Gup ranks count **downward** from 10th gup (white belt beginner) to 1st gup (red belt, just before black). Each gup promotion recognises mastery of specific techniques, forms, and knowledge.

## Dan Ranks (Black Belt)

Dan ranks count **upward** from 1st dan (shodan) through higher numbers. Most organisations recognise up to 9th or 10th dan, with higher ranks awarded for lifetime contribution rather than physical testing.

Key dan milestones:

- **1st-3rd Dan:** Student/assistant instructor level

- **4th-6th Dan:** Instructor/master level

- **7th-9th Dan:** Grandmaster level

- **10th Dan:** Reserved for founders or exceptional grandmasters

## WT vs ITF Belt Systems

The two major taekwondo organisations use slightly different belt systems:

## World Taekwondo (WT) - Olympic Style

The organisation governing Olympic taekwondo typically uses:

White → Yellow → Green → Blue → Red → Black

Some WT schools add orange and purple, and many use striped belts (e.g., yellow with green stripe) as interim ranks.

## International Taekwondo Federation (ITF)

ITF schools often use a 10-rank coloured belt system:

White → Yellow → Yellow/Green → Green → Green/Blue → Blue → Blue/Red → Red → Red/Black → Black

The stripe belts (e.g., yellow/green) represent intermediate ranks between solid colours.

## Belt Color Meanings in Taekwondo

Each taekwondo belt colour carries symbolic meaning that reflects the student's development:

## White Belt

White represents purity and innocence. The student begins with no knowledge and an open mind, ready to learn. All practitioners start here, regardless of experience in other martial arts.

## Yellow Belt

Yellow symbolises earth or a seed planted in the ground. The student has established a foundation and is beginning to grow. Basic techniques are becoming natural.

## Green Belt

Green represents a growing plant. The student's skills are flourishing, and technique is becoming more refined. Power and speed are developing.

## Blue Belt

Blue symbolises the sky or heaven. As a plant grows toward the sky, the student reaches toward higher achievement. Techniques are becoming more advanced and the student begins understanding deeper principles.

## Red Belt

Red signifies danger and caution. The student now possesses significant power that must be controlled responsibly. This is the final coloured belt before black, representing near-mastery of fundamentals.

## Black Belt

Black represents maturity and the opposite of white—the student has absorbed knowledge and completed the beginner's journey. However, black belt marks the **beginning** of true taekwondo study, not its end.

## Requirements for Belt Advancement

Each belt promotion requires demonstrating specific skills. While requirements vary by school and organisation, typical testing includes:

## Patterns (Poomsae/Tul)

Choreographed sequences of techniques performed solo. Each belt has assigned patterns that must be memorised and performed correctly.

## Basic Techniques (Gibon)

Fundamental kicks, strikes, blocks, and stances demonstrated with proper form.

## Sparring (Kyorugi)

Controlled fighting against opponents, demonstrating ability to apply techniques under pressure.

## Breaking (Kyukpa)

Board or concrete breaking to demonstrate power and technique. Often required at higher belt levels.

## Self-Defence (Hosinsul)

Practical defence techniques against grabs, holds, and attacks.

## Theory

Knowledge of Korean terminology, taekwondo history, and philosophical principles.

## How Long to Get a Black Belt in Taekwondo?

Most students require 3-5 years of consistent training to reach 1st dan black belt. The timeline depends on:

- **Training frequency:** 2-3 times per week is typical for recreational students

- **Testing intervals:** Schools typically test every 2-4 months

- **Minimum age:** Many organisations require students to be 15-16 for adult black belt

- **Organisation standards:** Some schools promote faster than others

Children may earn "junior black belt" (poom) before age 15, which converts to adult 1st dan upon reaching the minimum age.

## Tracking Taekwondo Belt Progression

Modern taekwondo schools use [martial arts software](/martial-arts-software/) to track student progression through the belt ranks. These systems monitor:

- Current rank and complete belt history

- Time-in-rank for promotion eligibility

- Attendance requirements (classes since last promotion)

- Pattern/poomsae curriculum completion

- Testing registration and results

For schools teaching multiple martial arts or offering both WT and ITF programmes, software that handles multiple ranking systems simultaneously streamlines administration significantly.

## Frequently Asked Questions

## What is the order of taekwondo belts?

The most common taekwondo belt order is: white, yellow, green, blue, red, black. Some schools include orange and purple, and many use striped belts as intermediate ranks between solid colours.

## How many belts are there in taekwondo?

Most taekwondo schools have 10 coloured belt ranks (gup) before black belt, though the specific colours vary. Including intermediate/striped belts, some schools have 15-20 levels before 1st dan black belt.

## What is the highest belt in taekwondo?

The highest belt in taekwondo is typically 9th or 10th dan black belt. These ranks are reserved for grandmasters with decades of experience and significant contributions to the art. 10th dan is often awarded posthumously or to founders.

## What is the difference between WTF and ITF taekwondo belts?

WT (World Taekwondo, Olympic style) typically uses fewer belt colours with stripes for intermediate ranks. ITF uses more distinct belt colours including combination colours (yellow/green, green/blue, etc.). The techniques and forms also differ between organisations.

## How long does it take to get a black belt in taekwondo?

Most students take 3-5 years to reach 1st dan black belt with consistent training (2-3 times per week). Children may earn junior black belt (poom) earlier, which converts to adult rank at age 15-16.

## What does a red belt mean in taekwondo?

Red belt signifies danger and represents the student's developing power that must be controlled. It is the final coloured belt before black, indicating near-mastery of fundamental techniques and readiness for black belt preparation.

## Is taekwondo belt order the same as karate?

No. While both use coloured belts progressing to black, the specific colours and order differ. Taekwondo typically emphasises red belt before black, while [karate belt order](/blog/karate-belts/) often uses brown belt at the advanced level. The meanings and testing requirements also vary between arts.
