## Funding Options

### Self-Funding

- Personal savings
- Home equity
- Retirement accounts (with caution)

**Pros:** No debt, full ownership
**Cons:** Personal financial risk

### Traditional Loans

- SBA loans (7(a), microloans)
- Bank business loans
- Credit union loans

**Typical terms:**
- Interest: 6-12%
- Term: 5-10 years
- Down payment: 10-30%

**Requirements:**
- Good personal credit
- Business plan
- Collateral often required

### Alternative Financing

- Equipment financing (equipment as collateral)
- Business lines of credit
- Investor partners
- Crowdfunding

### Friends and Family

Common for small startups but proceed carefully:
- Document everything legally
- Set clear expectations
- Treat it as formal investment

## Cost-Saving Strategies

### Reduce Initial Investment

**Space:**
- Start smaller than ideal
- Sublease existing gym space
- Use warehouse/industrial zoning
- Negotiate lease terms

**Equipment:**
- Buy quality used equipment
- Start minimal, expand as revenue grows
- Lease instead of buy (for some items)
- Build some items (bag stands, storage)

**Build-out:**
- Do work yourself where legal and safe
- Hire for specialised work only
- Phase improvements over time

### Reduce Ongoing Costs

**Staffing:**
- Owner-operator model initially
- Contract instructors vs employees
- Trade work for training

**Marketing:**
- Focus on organic growth initially
- Leverage social media
- Build referral programs

**Operations:**
- Energy-efficient equipment
- Careful scheduling (peak hours)
- Preventive maintenance

## Common Financial Mistakes

### Underestimating Costs

Most new gym owners underestimate:
- Build-out complexity
- Insurance costs
- Marketing investment needed
- Time to profitability

**Solution:** Add 20-30% buffer to all estimates.

### Insufficient Working Capital

Opening the doors isn't enough—you need runway until profitable.

**Solution:** Plan for 6 months of expenses as reserve.

### Overspending on Equipment

Buying top-tier equipment when starting can drain capital needed elsewhere.

**Solution:** Start functional, upgrade as revenue allows.

### Location Over-Reach

Premium location costs can sink a business before it establishes.

**Solution:** Balance visibility with affordability. Great instruction can overcome modest location.

### Ignoring Variable Costs

Focusing only on fixed costs misses variable expenses that grow with members.

**Solution:** Model costs at different membership levels.

## Creating Your Budget

### Step 1: Research Local Costs

- Visit commercial real estate sites for rent data
- Get insurance quotes specific to your area
- Research local business registration requirements
- Talk to other gym owners if possible

### Step 2: Define Your Model

- Size of space needed
- Equipment requirements
- Staffing plan
- Service offerings

### Step 3: Build Detailed Budget

List every anticipated expense with:
- Low estimate
- Expected cost
- High estimate

### Step 4: Stress Test

- What if revenue takes 6 months longer?
- What if costs are 20% higher?
- What's your break-even member count?

### Step 5: Secure Appropriate Funding

Match funding to realistic needs, including reserves.

## Summary

Opening a gym requires:

**Small martial arts school:** $50,000-$150,000
**Mid-size facility:** $100,000-$300,000
**Full-service gym:** $200,000-$1,000,000+

Key factors:
