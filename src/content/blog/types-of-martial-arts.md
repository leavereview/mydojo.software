A Guide to Fighting Styles, Combat Systems, and Training Methods

Martial arts encompass hundreds of distinct fighting systems developed across every inhabited continent over thousands of years. From the striking arts of Southeast Asia to the grappling traditions of Brazil and Japan, each style reflects the culture and practical needs of its origin.

This guide examines the major categories of martial arts, introduces the most popular styles, and helps you understand what distinguishes one art from another.

## How Martial Arts Are Categorised

Martial arts can be organised by primary technique (striking vs grappling), by country of origin, or by training emphasis (self-defence vs sport vs traditional).

## Striking Arts

These martial arts focus on punches, kicks, elbows, and knees delivered while standing. Training emphasises footwork, timing, and power generation.

## Grappling Arts

These arts emphasise controlling opponents through holds, throws, and ground fighting rather than strikes. Training develops sensitivity to balance and leverage.

## Hybrid or Mixed Arts

Some martial arts incorporate both striking and grappling, either through historical development or intentional combination of techniques.

## Traditional Striking Arts

## Karate

Originating in Okinawa, Japan, karate emphasises powerful punches, kicks, and blocks from stable stances. Training includes kata (forms), kumite (sparring), and kihon (basics). Major styles include Shotokan, Goju-Ryu, Shito-Ryu, and Wado-Ryu.

Karate uses a coloured belt system, typically requiring 3-5 years to achieve black belt. Modern karate includes both traditional practice and Olympic sport competition.

## Taekwondo

This Korean martial art is famous for spectacular kicking techniques, including spinning and jumping kicks. As an Olympic sport since 2000, taekwondo has a well-developed competition circuit emphasising flexibility and speed.

## Kung Fu (Wushu)

Kung fu is a general term for Chinese martial arts, encompassing hundreds of distinct styles including Wing Chun, Shaolin, and Tai Chi. Training may include weapons, forms, sparring, and qigong energy cultivation.

## Muay Thai

Thai boxing utilises punches, kicks, elbows, and knee strikes - the art of eight limbs. Muay Thai clinch work distinguishes it from other striking arts. It has become the striking foundation for many MMA fighters.

## Boxing

Western boxing focuses exclusively on punches with refined footwork, head movement, and punching mechanics. The sweet science reflects strategic sophistication within its focused ruleset.

## Kickboxing

Kickboxing combines boxing punches with kicks. Modern kickboxing under Glory or K-1 rules allows punches, kicks, and knees and has become a major international combat sport.

## Grappling Arts

## Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ)

BJJ specialises in ground fighting, using positions and submissions to control opponents regardless of size. The art uses a belt system (white, blue, purple, brown, black) with black belt typically taking 10+ years.

## Judo

Judo focuses on throwing opponents and controlling them on the ground. An Olympic sport since 1964, judo introduced the belt ranking system later adopted by karate and other arts.

## Wrestling

Wrestling traditions exist worldwide, from American folkstyle to Greco-Roman. As one of the original Olympic sports, wrestling produces athletes with exceptional takedown ability and top control.

## Sambo

Russian sambo combines judo-style throws with wrestling and submissions. Combat sambo adds strikes, making it one of the most complete fighting systems.

## Hybrid and Mixed Martial Arts

## Mixed Martial Arts (MMA)

MMA is a competitive format allowing techniques from all martial arts. Modern MMA fighters train multiple disciplines: wrestling for takedowns, BJJ for ground fighting, and Muay Thai or boxing for striking.

## Krav Maga

Developed for the Israeli military, Krav Maga emphasises practical self-defence against real-world violence including weapons and multiple attackers.

## Belt and Ranking Systems

Most martial arts use some form of ranking system to mark student progression. The coloured belt system, now universal in karate, taekwondo, and judo, was invented in the 1880s and has spread across martial arts worldwide.

For a detailed breakdown of how belt colours work, see our complete guide to [karate belt colors and order](/blog/karate-belts/).

Different arts use different systems:

- **Karate, Taekwondo, Judo:** Coloured belt progression from white to black

- **Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu:** White, blue, purple, brown, black (typically 10+ years to black belt)

- **Boxing, Wrestling, MMA:** No formal ranking—skill demonstrated through competition

- **Kung Fu:** Varies by style; some use sashes, others use no formal ranking

## Choosing a Martial Art

## Running a Martial Arts School

For those interested in teaching martial arts professionally, managing a school requires balancing instruction with business administration. Modern [martial arts software](/martial-arts-software/) helps school owners handle student management, scheduling, billing, and belt progression tracking—freeing up time to focus on teaching.

Schools teaching multiple disciplines, such as MMA academies offering BJJ, striking, and wrestling, benefit from [MMA gym software](/mma-gym-software/) that can track progression across different ranking systems simultaneously.

- For self-defence: Consider BJJ, Muay Thai, Krav Maga, or a combination

- For fitness: Any martial art provides excellent conditioning

- For competition: Match the art to available competitions in your area

- For children: Karate and taekwondo have well-developed youth programmes

- For tradition: Karate, kung fu, and judo preserve cultural heritage

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q1: What is the most effective martial art?A: **Effectiveness depends on context. For self-defence, arts with live sparring like BJJ, Muay Thai, wrestling, and boxing have proven effective. MMA combines multiple arts for complete fighting ability. The best martial art is one you will train consistently.

**Q2: What is the best martial art for beginners?A: **Karate, taekwondo, and BJJ all have structured curricula well-suited for beginners. The best choice depends on your goals and what schools are available in your area. Try introductory classes at several schools before committing.

**Q3: How many types of martial arts are there?A: **There are hundreds of documented martial arts worldwide. Major categories include Japanese arts (karate, judo, aikido), Korean arts (taekwondo, hapkido), Chinese arts (various kung fu styles), Southeast Asian arts (Muay Thai, silat), and Western combat sports (boxing, wrestling).

**Q4: What martial art should I learn for self-defence?A: **For practical self-defence, consider arts with regular sparring against resisting opponents: Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu for ground situations, Muay Thai or boxing for striking, and wrestling for controlling distance and position. Krav Maga specifically addresses self-defence scenarios.

**Q5: What is the difference between karate and taekwondo?A: **Both are striking arts with belt systems, but they differ in emphasis. Karate balances hand and foot techniques with powerful, grounded stances. Taekwondo emphasises high, flashy kicks and lighter footwork. Competition rules also differ significantly.

**Q6: Can I train multiple martial arts?A: **Yes, cross-training is common and beneficial. MMA is built on combining multiple arts. Many practitioners train both a striking art and a grappling art. The key is finding quality instruction and managing training volume to avoid burnout.
