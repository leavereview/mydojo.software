## Common Mistakes

### Inconsistent Effort

**Problem:** Marketing in bursts, then nothing.
**Solution:** Create consistent, sustainable schedule.

### No Clear Call-to-Action

**Problem:** Marketing without asking for action.
**Solution:** Every piece should lead somewhere specific.

### Ignoring Follow-Up

**Problem:** Collecting leads but not contacting them.
**Solution:** Follow up within 24 hours, have a sequence.

### Generic Messaging

**Problem:** "Learn martial arts" without differentiation.
**Solution:** Specific benefits, unique value proposition.

### Neglecting Retention Marketing

**Problem:** Focus only on new students, ignore existing.
**Solution:** Member communication and [retention strategies](/blog/member-retention-strategies/).

## Budget Allocation

### Suggested Breakdown

**For a typical school:**

| Category | Percentage |
|----------|------------|
| Google Ads | 30% |
| Social media ads | 25% |
| Events/community | 20% |
| Content creation | 15% |
| Print/local | 10% |

### Measuring ROI

**Calculate cost per student:**
Total marketing spend ÷ new students = cost per acquisition

**Benchmark:**
Most schools spend £50-£200 to acquire a new student. Lower is better.

**Lifetime value consideration:**
A student staying 2 years at £80/month = £1,920 value. Spending £150 to acquire them is worthwhile.
