The world of martial arts encompasses hundreds of distinct styles, each with unique philosophies, techniques, and training methods. Whether you're considering starting martial arts training or simply curious about different disciplines, this guide provides a comprehensive overview of major martial arts styles.

For schools teaching multiple disciplines, [martial arts software](/martial-arts-software/) helps manage the complexity of different belt systems, class types, and curriculum requirements.

## Categorising Martial Arts

### Striking Arts

Striking arts focus on punches, kicks, knees, and elbows delivered while standing.

### Grappling Arts

Grappling arts emphasise holds, throws, joint locks, and ground control rather than strikes.

### Hybrid/Mixed Arts

Hybrid arts combine striking and grappling, recognising that real confrontations can happen at any range.

### Weapons-Based Arts

These arts centre on traditional weapons training, though they often include empty-hand techniques.

### Internal/Soft Arts

Internal arts emphasise energy cultivation, breath work, and subtle movement rather than external force.
