## Common CRM Mistakes

### Overcomplicating

Starting with complex automation and workflows before mastering basics. Start simple, add complexity as needed.

### Inconsistent Use

CRM only works if everyone uses it consistently. Partial adoption creates incomplete data and lost leads.

### Too Many Stages

Complex pipelines with many stages create confusion. Start with 4-6 stages maximum.

### Ignoring Data

Collecting data but not reviewing reports. Set regular review cadence.

### No Follow-Up Strategy

Having CRM but no clear process for what to do at each stage.

## Building Your Follow-Up Process

### Example Stage Process

**Stage 1: New Inquiry**
- Action: Personal response within 2 hours
- Content: Thank them, answer questions, invite to trial
- Move to: Trial Scheduled or No Response

**Stage 2: Trial Scheduled**
- Action: Confirmation email, reminder texts
- Content: What to bring, what to expect
- Move to: Trial Completed or No Show

**Stage 3: Trial Completed**
- Action: Follow-up call within 24 hours
- Content: How did they like it? Questions? Ready to join?
- Move to: Ready to Join or Needs Time

**Stage 4: Ready to Join**
- Action: Close the sale
- Content: Enrollment options, payment, start date
- Move to: Enrolled or Lost

**Stage 5: Needs Time**
- Action: Nurture sequence
- Content: Value content, social proof, soft offers
- Move to: Ready to Join or Lost
