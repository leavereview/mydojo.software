## How to Choose

### Step 1: Define Your Requirements

**Must-have features:**
List features you absolutely need (belt tracking, specific billing needs, etc.)

**Nice-to-have features:**
Features that would help but aren't essential

**Deal-breakers:**
Things that would rule out a platform (long contracts, high fees, missing critical features)

### Step 2: Set Your Budget

**Consider total cost:**
- Monthly subscription
- Transaction fees on payments
- Setup/migration fees
- Training costs
- Hardware needs

**Calculate per-student cost:**
Monthly cost ÷ student count = cost per student

### Step 3: Trial Multiple Options

Most platforms offer free trials. Use them to:
- Set up your actual belt structure
- Enter real student data
- Test billing workflows
- Evaluate daily usability
- Train staff and get feedback

### Step 4: Check References

**Ask vendors for:**
- References from similar-sized schools
- Schools teaching your art(s)
- Schools that switched from what you use now

**Questions for references:**
- What do you like most?
- What frustrates you?
- How's the support?
- Would you choose it again?

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Choosing Based on Price Alone

The cheapest option may cost more through:
- Lost time with poor usability
- Missing features requiring workarounds
- Poor support when problems arise
- Transaction fees adding up

### Over-Buying Features

Don't pay for capabilities you won't use:
- Complex marketing automation you won't set up
- Advanced reporting you won't analyse
- Integrations with systems you don't use
- Features designed for different business types

### Ignoring the Transition

Consider migration costs:
- Time to set up new system
- Data migration complexity
- Staff training requirements
- Student communication needs

### Long-Term Contract Lock-In

Avoid:
- Multi-year commitments
- High early termination fees
- Auto-renewal traps
- Unclear exit terms

## Future Considerations

### Technology Trends

**Watch for:**
- AI-powered scheduling and communication
- Improved mobile experiences
- Better integration capabilities
- Enhanced reporting and analytics
- Video and content delivery features

### Your Growth Plans

**Consider:**
- Will this scale with you?
- Can you add locations?
- What happens if student count doubles?
- Are there growth-based pricing increases?
