## Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Belt Ranks: The Complete Guide to BJJ Belt Order and Progression

The Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu belt system represents one of the most demanding progression paths in martial arts. Unlike karate or taekwondo where black belt might be achieved in 3-5 years, BJJ practitioners typically spend 10-15 years reaching black belt—a timeline that reflects the art's depth and the skill required at each level.

This guide covers everything about the BJJ belt ranking system: the order of belts, what each rank represents, typical promotion timelines, and how the stripe system works between belt levels.

## BJJ Belt Order: White to Black

Adult BJJ uses five belt colours in a fixed order:

**BeltMinimum AgeTypical Time at BeltWhat It Represents**White16+1-2 yearsBeginning. Learning fundamental positions, escapes, and basic submissions.Blue16+2-3 yearsTechnical foundation. Can defend against untrained opponents and apply basic techniques.Purple16+2-3 yearsIntermediate. Developing personal game, teaching ability emerges.Brown18+1-2 yearsAdvanced. Refining techniques, preparing for black belt responsibilities.Black19+LifetimeExpert level. Mastery of fundamentals, ability to teach and develop new students.

Beyond black belt, BJJ continues with coral belt (red and black, then red and white) and ultimately red belt (9th and 10th degree), though these highest ranks are reserved for pioneers and lifetime contributors to the art.

## The Stripe System

Between belt promotions, instructors award stripes (degrees) to mark progress. Most schools use 4 stripes per belt, applied as tape around the belt's black bar (or red bar for black belts).

Stripes typically represent:

- **1st stripe:** Basic competency at current belt level

- **2nd stripe:** Consistent technique application

- **3rd stripe:** Developing advanced skills for current rank

- **4th stripe:** Ready or nearly ready for next belt promotion

The stripe system provides more frequent recognition than belt promotions alone, helping maintain student motivation during the long journey between belts.

## White Belt: The Beginning

Every BJJ practitioner starts at white belt regardless of experience in other martial arts. The white belt phase focuses on survival: learning to protect yourself, escape bad positions, and understand fundamental concepts like base, posture, and pressure.

**Key skills developed at white belt:**

- Basic positions (mount, guard, side control, back control)

- Fundamental escapes from each position

- Simple submissions (armbar, triangle, rear naked choke)

- Breakfalls and basic takedowns

- Training etiquette and safety

Most students spend 1-2 years at white belt. Promotion to blue belt typically requires demonstrating solid defensive skills and basic attacking ability.

## Blue Belt: Technical Foundation

Blue belt marks the transition from survival to attack. Blue belts can effectively control untrained opponents and begin developing preferred techniques and positions.

This is often the belt where practitioners face the greatest dropout risk—the initial excitement has faded but mastery remains years away. Those who persist through blue belt typically become lifelong practitioners.

**Blue belt expectations:**

- Solid escapes from all major positions

- Multiple submission options from guard and mount

- Basic guard passing

- Understanding of leverage and timing

- Ability to roll (spar) safely and continuously

## Purple Belt: Developing Your Game

Purple belt represents the intermediate stage where practitioners develop their personal style. Rather than learning everything equally, purple belts begin specialising in positions and techniques that suit their body type and preferences.

At purple belt, many practitioners begin assistant teaching roles, helping beginners understand fundamentals while deepening their own knowledge through instruction.

## Brown Belt: Advanced Refinement

Brown belt is the final preparation for black belt. Techniques are refined, gaps in knowledge are filled, and practitioners develop the well-rounded game expected of black belts.

The minimum age for brown belt is 18, and IBJJF rules require at least 18 months between receiving brown and being eligible for black belt.

## Black Belt: The Beginning of Mastery

Despite representing perhaps a decade of training, black belt in BJJ is considered the beginning of true mastery rather than its conclusion. Black belts continue learning and refining their art for the rest of their lives.

Black belt degrees (marked by stripes or bars on the belt) continue up to 6th degree, after which practitioners may receive coral belts and eventually red belt at the highest levels.

## Kids Belt System

Children under 16 use a different belt system with more intermediate colours, providing more frequent promotions suited to younger attention spans:

White → Grey → Yellow → Orange → Green

Each kids belt may have white, solid, and black variations (e.g., grey-white, solid grey, grey-black), creating up to 13 levels before reaching the adult system at age 16.

## How Long Does Each Belt Take?

Total time to black belt varies significantly based on training frequency, natural ability, competition focus, and instructor standards. Typical timelines:

- **Recreational (2-3 days/week):** 12-15 years to black belt

- **Dedicated (4-5 days/week):** 8-12 years to black belt

- **Professional/competitive (daily training):** 6-10 years to black belt

There are no shortcuts. Even world-champion competitors typically spend 8+ years reaching black belt.

## Promotion Criteria

Unlike arts with standardised testing, BJJ promotions are typically awarded at the instructor's discretion based on:

- Technical knowledge and execution

- Live sparring performance against various skill levels

- Time training consistently

- Competition results (valued but not required)

- Character and contribution to the academy

Some academies hold formal gradings while others surprise students with promotions during regular training.

## Tracking BJJ Progression

Given the long timeline between belts, tracking progress becomes important for both students and instructors. Modern [martial arts software](/martial-arts-software/) helps academies monitor:

- Stripe and belt promotion history

- Training attendance patterns

- Time-in-rank for promotion eligibility

- Curriculum completion for technique checklists

- Competition records

[MMA gym software](/mma-gym-software/) can track BJJ progression alongside other disciplines for academies teaching multiple arts.

## Frequently Asked Questions

## What is the order of BJJ belts?

The adult BJJ belt order is: white, blue, purple, brown, black. Beyond black belt are coral belts (7th-8th degree) and red belt (9th-10th degree). Children use a separate system with grey, yellow, orange, and green belts.

## How long does it take to get a BJJ blue belt?

Most practitioners earn blue belt after 1-2 years of consistent training (2-4 times per week). The exact timeline depends on training frequency, natural ability, and instructor standards.

## Why does BJJ take so long to get a black belt?

BJJ's emphasis on live sparring (rolling) means techniques must work against resisting opponents, not just in forms or controlled drills. This practical standard, combined with the art's technical depth, requires years of development at each belt level.

## What do stripes mean on a BJJ belt?

Stripes mark progress between belt promotions. Most schools award 4 stripes per belt, applied as tape on the belt's bar. They help maintain motivation during the long periods between belt promotions.

## Can you skip belts in BJJ?

Belt skipping is extremely rare in BJJ. The art's culture values time on the mat and gradual development. Even exceptional athletes or those with extensive grappling backgrounds typically progress through each belt, though possibly at an accelerated pace.

## Is a BJJ blue belt good?

A BJJ blue belt represents significant achievement—typically 1-2 years of dedicated training. Blue belts can effectively control untrained opponents and have solid fundamental skills. In absolute terms, blue belts are competent grapplers, though still early in their BJJ journey.

## What's the difference between BJJ and jiu-jitsu belts?

Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu uses white, blue, purple, brown, and black belts. Traditional Japanese Jiu-Jitsu may use a karate-style system with more intermediate colours (yellow, orange, green). The belt colours and progression timelines differ between these related but distinct arts.

## How do BJJ academies track belt progression?

Modern academies use [martial arts management software](/martial-arts-software/) to track attendance, stripe awards, belt promotions, and curriculum progress. This helps instructors monitor student development and ensures promotion eligibility requirements are met.
